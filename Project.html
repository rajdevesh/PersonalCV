    <h1 class="His">History of Chhath Puja</h1>
    <p class="Dis">
        Chhath Puja is an age-old Hindu festival which is dedicated to Lord Surya (Sun God) and Chhathi Maiya,
         who is known to be the sister of Lord Surya. This festival is unique to the states of Bihar, Jharkhand,
          Eastern Uttar Pradesh and the country of Nepal. It’s the only festival that is dedicated to Lord Surya,
           who is supposed to be the source of all powers. The God of light, life force and energy is worshipped in
            order to promote well-being, development and the prosperity of human beings. Devotees express their gratitude
             towards Lord Surya and perform important rituals over a for a span of four days.
              People who observe the fast during this festival are called Vrati.

    <p class="Dis">
    
        In both Nepali and Hindi languages, the word Chhath means six. And hence, this festival is celebrated on the sixth
         day of the month of Karthika. Therefore, the festival is named Chhath.
        </p>
    
        <h1 class="Dev">How it celebrate</h1>
        <p class="puja">
            
        
        It is dedicated to the Sun God (Surya Dev) and Chhathi (Shashti) Devi or Maiya (Mother) and clocked twice
         every year— during two Indian months — Chaitra (March-April) and Kartika (October-November).
        </p>
        
        
        <p class="puja">
        In Bihar, it is the latter that is believed and famous, and occurs 6 days after Diwali. "It falls in Suklapaskh of
         Kartika Maasa (month),” says Rama, a rural artisan of Samoolam Crafts India in Gaya (Bihar). 
        </p>
        
        
        <p class="puja">
        According to her, Shukla Paksha is the waxing moon period of 15 days, starting on a new moon (Amavasya)
         and ending on a full moon (Purnima). 
        </p>
        
        
        <p class="puja">
        Women sing songs and celebrate the six-day-long period with happy festivities and lot of colour in their lives, 
        surroundings, clothing and food. 
        </p>
        
        
        
        <p class="puja">
        But the women observe a grave fast, sometimes even without water, what is known as Nir Jal Vrat. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="puja">
        Finally, at the end of the phase, the fast is broken by cooking and eating a range of simple, homecooked but
         delectable dishes like chana dal (cooked Bengal gram), arwa chawal (boiled rice) (arwa chawal), lauki sabji
          and saag (bottle gourd curry and greens), and mitti ke bartan mein banni gur ka kheer (rice pudding cooked
           in an earthen pot). 
        </p>
        
        
        <p class="puja">
        Chhath Puja is not idolatry in nature and a number of environmentalists consider it as a very eco-friendly way 
        of celebrating the elements of Nature (derived from age-old Pagan worship). 
        </p>
        
        
        <p class="puja">
        The women believe this rigorous fasting, when combined with auspicious celebration and handmade details, 
        fulfils all their wishes (manokamna).
